This program uses network variables to communicate between two progams ("Newfi" and "Washer HCC Newfi Main"). The reasoning is as follows:

1) Laundry.Net DLL are not re-enterant. You have to have dedicated .dlls for each program
2) It allows network published variables to allow the server to display the whole lab on one computer
2) Each Newfi program takes alot of memory so i can only run 24 per computer (working on memory managment)


Installation:

1) Most configurations are saved in INI files to allow changes without modifiy the program
2) It uses a windows API to bring front panels to the front. Each Newfi application need to be renamed to a unique name (manually)
3) Make sure you itemize each board ID, Station, and corresponding Aglient card position (101,102..ect)
4) The setup is located at C:/Newfi Exe
5) It allows you to search debugs for specific commands (update the "Error Code List.csv"
6) It also uses keys to save the latest configuration. It will save every cycle. This allows you to shut down and restart exactly where you where at.
