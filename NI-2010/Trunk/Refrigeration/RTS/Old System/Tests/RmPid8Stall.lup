! Dry - PID loop for main room sensor
! Wet - PID loop for stea using main room sensor
! Heat - PID loop for supply duct TC and SCR heater
! Cool - PID for sensible coil using face temperature
! Dehum - PID for latent coil using face temp
!
! P = Loop gain, bigger is faster
!		Range is 0 - 300.00
! I = Loop integral, bigger is slower
!		Range is 0 - 3000.0

RmDryP1 = 2
RmDryI1 = 1500

RmHumP1 = 4
RmHumI1 = 1500
! 11/8/2015 8:18 PM I to 1500, P to 4
! 11/8/2015 8:17 PM P was 6, I was 2000
!RmHumP1 = 4 and I to 2000 1/4
!RmHumP1 = 2 and I to 2000 1/3 - Wandered +- 2.5
!RmHumP1 = 1 and I to 2000  - Wandered a bit
!RmHumP1 = 5 and I to 2000 12/26
!RmHumP1 = 3 and I to 10000 12/16 - Wasn't maintaining sp very well
!RmHumP1 = 6 12/16 8:00 am changed to 2 - Just to see - 
!RmHumP1 = 3 12/16 8:00 am changed to 6
!RmHumP1 = 5 12/16 8:00 am changed to 3 - Larger oscillations than at 5
!RmHumI1 = 20000 12/15 11:12 changed to 30000
!RmHumI1 = 15000 12/13 17:03 changed to 20000
!RmHumI1 = 10000 12/13 11:24 am changed to 15000
