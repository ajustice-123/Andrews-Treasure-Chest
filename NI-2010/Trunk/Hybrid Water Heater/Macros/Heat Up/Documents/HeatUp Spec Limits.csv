After 10-gallon draw- Determine Time or Gallons before lower heat source energizes (min),IF lower heat source does not energize before 10.75 gallon draw is finished-  Defined as: Time after 10.75 gallon flow stops- until Lower Heat source or Fans energize.  (Minutes),,,5
After 10-gallon draw- Determine Time or Gallons before lower heat source energizes (min),IF lower heat source energizes before 10.75 gallon draw is finished- record the Flow output reading taken when lower heat source or fans energize.   ( # gallons),2,5,11
