 -1950678955  LabVIEW:  (Hex 0x8BBB0055) The URL is invalid.  It contains one or more of the characters '#' or '?'. These characters are not allowed within a URL unless they are replaced with their percent encoded UTF-8 equivalent form.  For example, replace the '#' character with its percent encoded equivalent of "%23" and the '?' character with its percent encoded equivalent of "%3F". Refer to the "Variable Identifier URL Syntax" topic in the LabVIEW Help for more information.
 -1950678954  LabVIEW:  The string supplied for the Variable Engine portion of the URL is invalid.  The characters "_~!$&'()*,;=:/?#[]@" are not allowed in their decoded form. To specify one of these characters in a URL, you must replace these characters with their percent-encoded UTF-8 equivalents. Refer to the "Variable Identifier URL Syntax" topic in the LabVIEW Help for more information.
 -1950678953  LabVIEW:  The URL is invalid.  The URL has the general form "[Variable Engine]://" which indicates a host name should follow, but the URL does not specify a host name. To correct the problem, specify the host name of the computer that hosts the variable.  If the resource is hosted on the same computer where the VI is running, you can use the host name "localhost" or you can omit the host name entirely and use the following URL format: "[Variable Engine]:/[Container Name]/[Variable Name]".
 -1950678952  LabVIEW:  The URL is invalid.  The URL contains the User Information subcomponent within the Authority which isn't supported by this scheme.  If you included the "@" character as part of the Authority and didn't intend for it to signify the User Information field, replace the "@" character with its percent encode UTF-8 equivalent form of "%40".
 -1950678951  LabVIEW:  The host name specified in the URL is invalid.  It contains one or more of the characters ":/?#[]@" which are illegal to use in their decoded form.  If the host name contains one of these characters, replace it with its percent encoded UTF-8 equivalent form.  For example, to specify the host name "My Machine?" you must use the string "My Machine%3F".
 -1950678950  LabVIEW:  The port specified in the Authority component of the URL is invalid.  The port must consist of only numeric characters.
 -1950678949  LabVIEW:  The URL contains one or more unsupported path segments.  Path segments of the form "/./", "/../", and empty path segments "//" are not supported.
 -1950678948  LabVIEW:  The path specified in the URL is invalid.  The path contains one or more of the reserved characters "/?#[]!$&*+;=" which are illegal to use in their decoded form.  To identify resources that contain these characters as part of their name, replace the reserved character with its percent-encoded UTF-8 equivalent form.  For example, "scheme://host/PathSegment1/channel#1" becomes "scheme://host/PathSegment1/channel%231" where "%23" is the percent encoded UTF-8 equivalent form for the "#" character. Refer to the "Variable Identifier URL Escape Codes" topic in the LabVIEW Help for more information.
 -1950678947  LabVIEW:  The specified URL is invalid.  The URL specifies a host name that includes a port.  However, ports are not supported by the specified variable engine.
 -1950678946  LabVIEW:  The specified URL contains a relative path reference, but LabVIEW does not support relative paths in Variable URLs. To correct the problem, use absolute path references instead of relative references. Variable URLs must take one of the following three forms: (1) [Variable Engine]://[Host Name]/[Container Name]/[Variable Name] or (2) //[Host Name]/[Container Name]/[Variable Name] or (3) /[Container Name]/[Variable Name].
 -1950678945  LabVIEW:  The URL specifies a host name that does not correspond to the local host, but LabVIEW only supports the specified operation on the local host. You cannot perform the specified operation on a remotely hosted variable.
 -1950678944  LabVIEW:  The Class ID for the Variable Object identified by the URL is incompatible with the refnum configuration.  The class of the Variable Object is not equivalent to or does not derive from the class configured on the refnum.
 -1950678943  LabVIEW:  Timed out while attempting to open a connection to the variable.
 -1950678942  LabVIEW:  Scaling coerce attribute not specified.
 -1950678941  LabVIEW:  An empty string is not a valid URL.  If you want to reference the root container within a variable engine, you need to specify the path explicitly using one of the following URL formats: "[Variable Engine]://[Host Name]", "[Variable Engine]:", or "/".

       40624  LabVIEW:  One of the values has been overwritten before it has been sent.  This warning is reported for non-shared-memory variables that have been written for more than once in a single network cycle.
       40625  LabVIEW:  No data has been sent from this channel in the previous network cycle because write operation has been delayed beyond a preconfigured threshold.  The delay was probably caused by an interrupt.
       40626  LabVIEW:  Clock synchronization algorithm failed because enough cycle start packets have been missed - no more write network transactions will be allowed until the deterministic communication engine is restarted.
       40628  LabVIEW:  Read had to be retried at least once before it succeeded due to new data being placed into the buffer
       40630  LabVIEW:  Network transmission violated requested timing.  See documentation for more information about what might have caused the error and how can it be avoided
