Corey,
 
Attached are some screenshots. One has all of the individual “console” screens of the RTS processes being managed by AlwaysUp, another with just the Chamber 1 process, which appears to have all of the measurement/control for that chamber. The 3rd one is simply the AlwaysUp Management App.
 
I don’t recall opening specific ports, etc, but Hooks has admin rights on the server, so they might have tweaked a few things like that.
