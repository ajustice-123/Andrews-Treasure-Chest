1. Go to Gmail.com

10. While signed in to Google:  https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha

There is also a link you can use to tell gmail that the account will be accessed by the PLC:

“Google have to allow your app to use your own account, to allow this google provided an easy way, 
just go to https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha, then click continue, then with 10 min, 
use your application to try to send email again, and google will remember the application/service 
and allow your application to access your account as long as you don't change your password.”


11. While signed in to Google, link to make it less secure:
    https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

Once I did either step 10 and/or step 11 emails started going through.
